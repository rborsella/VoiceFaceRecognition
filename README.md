# VoiceFaceRecognition
Voice and Face Recognition Windows Form App

This is just the beginning of a project that processes face recognition (using a webcam) and voice recognition 
(using a microphone). 

Basic commands that are available (as of the writing of this README):

My Name is <your name>.  // can only process names that are already in the code. If lost look for Michael and add your 
			    name to the list.
Who am I. // If you have already saved your face in the program.The application will tell you what your name is. 

Tell me a joke. // Tells one silly joke. (eventually will be expanded to multiple silly jokes)

What is <number> plus <number>. // Adds two numbers together and tells you the result. (Currently only does #s 1-4)

Open Chrome. // Open the Chrome browser and goes to the google seach homepage. 

Close Chrome. // Closes all processes associated with Chrome (WILL CLOSE OPEN BROWSER COMPLETELY. USE WITH CAUTION!)

These are the basic function as of right now. Stay tuned for more to come.
